# odin-calculator
The calculator project, which is the final project in The Odin Project's "Foundations" course.

I am excited to flex the skills I have learned in the Foundations course. I will need to utilize HTML and CSS to build the calculator's interface and work through JavaScript + DOM manipulation to make the calculator functional.
